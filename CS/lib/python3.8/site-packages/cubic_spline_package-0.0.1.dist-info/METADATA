Cubic Spline Package

Computes the cubic spline and the derivatives at a grid specified by the user.

Requires the user to specify two input files and a title for the output file.

The first file is a collection of x and y values (given as a .txt file with commas separating successive values, and the x and y vectors separated by '\n') and the second is a list of x values (separated by commas), which specifies the x-values at which to evaluate the cubic spline. The result is saved as a .txt file containing the values of the and the values of the first and second derivatives.
